There have been 16 year olds who wanted to learn new skills during their summers, both current college students and those who skipped the traditional university experience, people in their 30s who were looking for a fresh start in a different field, and even some over 50 who realized it’s never too late to learn new skills and start a new life and career.

                                                        EA is all about getting outside your existing context and challenging yourself each day. Going to another country (or city for Brazilians) does exactly that. Almost everything is new--the people, place, culture, language, food, problems, etc. Being confronted daily by this new context automatically puts you into problem-solving mode. It trains you think creatively on how to overcome the barriers that arise from this new version of reality in which you are living for 8 weeks.

                                                        The staff, fellows, and curators of EA expect the same level of excellence in themselves and the program as those from US-based educational programs. Many of the EA staff members are American, so you can get an American experience within the context of the timeless style and culture of Brazil.

                                                         Another main reason to come to EA is that programs in the US are typically comprised of Americans and maybe a few other nationalities. At EA, don't be surprised if 15+ countries are represented by just one group.

You will then receive an email with a set of application questions specific to the stream you have chosen (don’t worry, you can change later if you want). After reviewing your answers, a member of the EA admissions department will contact you.

If accepted, you will have 2 weeks to make a deposit to secure your spot in the program. After the establishment of a payment schedule (up to three installments), you will begin the onboarding process and will receive the rest of the information about logistics and preparation for the program.

Your efforts will be evaluated so that you can improve in the areas you are lacking, and try to perfect the areas where you excel. We cannot promise there will not be “homework.” But we can promise that if there is, it’s there for a reason and will benefit you.

However, some of our previous students have been able to get jobs such as Full Stack Developer at software startups or copywriter for a creative marketing agency, with many starting their own business or joining up with a co-founder for a new venture. 

                                                        Within the Creative Economy, your options are only limited to your own imagination and the value you can create.
