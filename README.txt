Hey guys! 

So this is a pretty simple setup we have here. These files were originally a theme called SMARTMVP.
I customized it alot for design and repsonsiveness. 

1. I need the facebook chat widget to work on the root url landing page. The code is in the head, but currently commented out. 
There is a problem with the widget and the "Streams" section of the landing page. 

2. We need event listeners set up for google analytics for all of the apply buttons on the landing page. 

style.css and responsive.css are the main style sheets. 

Let me know if you have any questions.
